narrator03_enconunters_stream.wav|Before the Twilight wars, Rogan Kayle thought himself a simple man with simple needs. It was only the attention of a Skylord that thrust him onto fates path. Yet while Rogan began life as neither wise nor noble, the spark of greatness was within him. The Skylord Viridya sensed this, and against her absent fathers expressed wished, urged other Skylords to aid her in creating a symbol of hope for the mortals. Some answered her call. Rogan showed mortals, if you are willing to stand up and fight for your home, the Skylords would aid your calls. Eternal glory or total damnation awaited the former thief, a fact history shows he became increasingly aware of.
narrator04_siegeofhope_stream.wav|As the first battle of the Twilight War loomed, it was clear the mortal races desperately needed aid. The leader of the Skylords, Brannoc, claiming victory could only achieved by finding the gods, had disappeared months before in what some of his fellow Skylords thought a fools' quest. Sheparded by his rebellious daughter Viridya, mortals, most of them humans of the northern Lyrish empire, gathered near the city called Hope. She believed, there they could both make a new beginning, and defend against the Twilight creatures. Further disobeying Brannoc, Viridya conviced some of the Skylords to use the Forge to conjure legendary creatures and wonders of old. Moon, his able lieutenant, remained silent in the face of Viridyas plans.
narrator05_siegeofhope_stream.wav|While humans celebrated their first victory, Viridya knew any respite would be brief. A cure for the curse was needed, should the world have a hope to survive. But the impulsive Skylord was convinced her fathers quest to find the gods was hopeless. The affliction had spread swiftly, and even now grew in power. Viridyas heart was torn as she watched the curse weave its vile taint into nature itself, upsetting the very balance she had sworn to protect.
narrator06_defendinghope_stream.wav|Viridya led the mortals to the city called Hope. Not only because it was a powerful city of rebirth, but because it was home to two Soulstones, mighty shrines created by mortals ages past in remembrance of giant war. Within them was said to slumber the wrath of a million spirits. Viridya hoped they would wake when the time was right.
narrator07_defendinghope_stream.wav|The soulstones had awakend, just as Viridya had hoped. But though the stones fury had brought victory, they were unable to destory the infection completly. The curse was wast, it gripped the entire world, and one did not have to be wise to know a far greater power was needed, if the mortal realm was to be cleansed. Though the struggle for hope was over, a new one began in Viridyas soul.
narrator08_soultree_stream.wav|Many ages past in the elemental wars, earth created the trees to defend against the wind. But the trees rebelled against their master and created the power of nature. Viridya had a powerful affinity to nature, and knew this ancient conflict had spawned its most powerful artifact - the mighty soultree. Within it she hoped to finally find the strength needed to rid the world of the Twilight curse. Moon watched, but still did nothing, believing perhaps in the purity of Viridyas intentions.
narrator09_soultree_stream.wav|Viridya had taken the soultree into herself, and merged with its ancient magic. While this granted her power far beyond that of the Forge, the soultrees ancient hate drove Viridya insane. Forced to action, Moon petitioned the other Skylords for aid. Their combined power was enought to banish Viridya from the forge. She fled, no longer a Skylord, instead a distorted creature of fey power. A new enemy to the Twilight had been created, though it remained to be seen if she was to be ally or foe to the Skylords
narrator10_crusade_stream.wav|Brannoc, master of the forge, said to be both powerful and wise, was the first and only leader of the Skylords installed by the gods. He had forbidden any to involve themselves in mortal struggles, instead ordering all to search for the missing gods. History points to the irony that it was not Brannocs almighty gaze which found the missing gods trail, but the mortals of Lyr. The very same mortals who would have been dead had all Skylords followed their leaders command. And even now, creatures cursed with the twilight taint surrounded them, attracted by the artifact they had discovered.
narrator11_crusade_stream.wav|The gods had found the fabled portals to the Sunbridge Shrine, one of the worlds most sacred places. Shrouded in magic to shield it from the greed of men and giant, its presence was hidden from even the Skylords. Later it was clear the gods must have been horribly weaked, they had to walk to the hallowed ground and dig like mortals to unearth the portal. And the longer the Skylords followed the track of the gods, the more powerful the twilight infection became.
narrator12_sunbridge_stream.wav|The gods had been the first infected by the curse. They had journeyed to the Sunbridge shrine to cleanse themselves of its taint. But by touching the Sunbridges holy light, they only spread the curse to the world. Even the sun was corrupted, and had become dark, driving the mortals underground. The curse had brought the twilight. One of the cursed gods still remained at the shrine - Mora, the god of growth. A twisted shadow of his former self, Mora was thought to be the only creature to point the Skylords to the source of the evil.
narrator13_sunbridge_stream.wav|Through battling the fallen god Mora, the source of the curse finally revealed itself: Brannoc, driven by a selfish desire to resurrect his long-dead wife, had cast it upon the gods to press the secret of creation from them. But once infected they had fled, and the curse spread, bringing with it the Twilight. But even as Moon, once more with the aid of her fellow Skylords, banished Brannoc from the forge, he vowed not to stop his search for the gods. He summoned his remaining power to create a monstrous body for himself and continue his hunt.
narrator14_badharvest_stream.wav|The treasure payed to the giants in exchange for the new sun had been stolen by the mortal king of fire, know to some as the red king. His actions brought the wrath of giants down on all mortals, yet one of the missing treasure wagons was found. The Lyrish humans sent a messanger to the giant king Jorne. They offered him the wagon in the hope of gaining a truce. But news of the treasure attracted marauders, who hungered not for peace, but simply blood and gold. With them came a rogue giant and his Stonekin minions.
narrator15_badharvest_stream.wav|Many in the mortal realm thought it likely that giants would not accept the mortals offer, but Jorne, the giant king, proofed willing to enter a short truce. Though his decision was not a popular one among his people, the wily Jorne saw the Twilight curse would eventually take its toll even on the giants. The truce lasted one short month, but served to show there could be peace between mortal and giant.
narrator16_treasurefleet_stream.wav|A group of the red kings guard was found dead. With them was several wagons loaded with casks - surely part of the booty their master had stolen. It was unclear if these guardsmen had tried to return the treasure, or make their forture with it. After the first wagonload had prooven so valuable in appeasing the giants, these casks had to been handed over to the mortals. But aid would have to be swift, as twilight cursed were about to flood the area.
narrator17_treasurefleet_stream.wav|The wagon reached the humans intact, but the casks did not carry treasure. Instead in each there cowered wounded orcs and sunelfs, servants of the red king. Protected by the ironbound containers they survived that which had killed their saviours. So while there was no treasure to give the giants, should the wounded recover, their knowledge would shed light on the fate of the red king and his misbegotten treasure.
narrator18_kingofgiants_stream.wav|Viridya, infused with the Soultrees awesome power, sought out Brannoc, determined he would pay for his crimes. But as father and daughter clashed, it became clear they were equal not only in rage, but might. Their epic struggle ravaged the land, and threatend to destroy the new human settlements. Rogan Kayle, desperate to stop the destruction, sought to lure the giant king Jorne into the fight. He reasoned bringing a third power into the frey would tip the balance and end the destruction. The price of failure was unthinkable.
narrator19_kingofgiants_stream.wav|Rogan Kayle knew how fond the giants were of their juwelery. Stealing a gem from the giants king crown were sure to get his undivided attention. Such an epic feat would have once garnered the respect of the thieving community. Now, it earned him the ire of one of the worlds oldest and most powerful creatures. Kayle knew, he would need skill, luck, and aid from the Skylords to successfully lure the brute to the battling titans.
narrator20_titans_stream.wav|While Kalye carried out his desperate plan with the enraged giant king, Brannoc and Viridyas struggle reached the outskirts of Lyr. As they fought on, wild magic ravaged the landscape, and their frenzied minions tore apart buildings and people with equal abandon. The fledgeling capital of the norther humans faced certain destruction.
narrator21_titans_stream.wav|Jornes arrival sparked an ancient, deep rooted hate in the spirit of the Soultree. Viridyas focus wavered, in that heartbeat Brannoc struck her down mightily, ending their struggle. Thus victorious, his rage turned to the giant king. But the mortal hopes and dread that gave that Skylord shape turned to hate in the face of his dark deeds. Brannocs power faltered. Thus weakened, the other Skylords and Jorne were able to destroy him. As Brannocs spirit passed into the realm of death, he finally saw he had been used. Blinded by love and desire, he has been forged into a weapon of darkness. A great regret swept through the former Skylord. He sent a message to Moon, telling her the curse had been whispered to him by the Harbinger, a terrible creature of the dark, that prowled the border between life and death.
narrator22_nightmareshard_stream.wav|Brannocs rage had torn free a shard of the forge. It fell earthward and crashed in the shattered lands. There its magic went wild. Still a part of the forge, it could turn the dreams of mortals into potent reality. But nearby were those infected with the curse, and it was their dreams that were born. Thus, twisted nightmares gave birth to darker dreams, made flesh that which should not exist. The twilight sensed the power of the shard. Soon, witches and other warped creatures, journeyed towards it.
narrator23_nightmareshard_stream.wav|With no twilight creatures to feed the shard their nightmares, it grew silent - but dangerous magic layed dormant in it shattered form, and such potential remained a dire threat.
narrator24_nightmareend_stream.wav|The nightmares streaming from the shard had stopped, but the forge fragment remained a danger to all. It could not be returned, so had to be destroyed. But such an act would not be easy.
narrator25_nightmareend_stream.wav|The pure force of the four powers was enough to destroy the shard. From this day, the Skylords saw the Forge with new eyes. It ceased to be just their home, a construct of great wonder. Shades of darkness now cloaked it too, for should the forge ever fall into the wrong hands, it could bring death to the world.
narrator26_riddle_stream.wav|Lyr desperatly needed a king, and struggle though he might, Rogan Kayle it was right he be chosen. His bond to the Skylords, and growing tales of his brave deeds made him loved by the people as well as respected by his man. But to become king, Lyrish law demanded one must possess the wisdom passed down from one ruler to the next: the secret to Lyrs magic defenses. With the former king dead, Rogan was forced to pursue the secret at its source, where the first monarch was said to have uncovered it. The Riddle of Gnaw, he who would store the wisdom of power within magical crystals would only be revealed who those who are at one with magic. But the cult who guarded Gnaws secrets and controlled his stonekin servants would not give up the knowledge without a struggle.
narrator27_riddle_stream.wav|The wisdom within Gnaws crystal had been revealed, but it was both profound and formless: There were no ancient magical defenses in Lyr. That which has been invented by kings of old to protect them from assassination now almost proofed to be Lyrs downfall. But with circumstances as they were, it was proven that simply being honest could yield the crown when the time was right.
narrator28_gunsoflyr_stream.wav|Rogan Kayle was now king of Lyr. His coronation took place in a ruined fortress and was said by many to have felt somewhat rushed. Yet such expediency proofed to be fortiutous, for that very day the Twilight attacked with unprecedented force. Were they driven by desperation? Did the Twilight hunger to snuff the tiny flicker of hope that now fluttered in mens hearts? With no magical wonders to aid them, the humans were forced to try and restore Lyrs ancient mechanical defenses, but the Twilight would not be stopped by rude cannons and simple walls alone.
narrator29_gunsoflyr_stream.wav|It had been an epic struggle, but the Twilight had been defeated. Though the lands of Lyr had been emptied of the cursed, the price of victory proofed high. What remained of Lyr had been razed, her old defenses finally destroyed. However, the new king had survived his first day, and some rejoiced at that alone. But as he adressed his battle-weary subjects for the first time, all Rogan could offer was the promise of yet another new beginning.
narrator30_madgod_stream.wav|Mora had been slain at the Sunbridge shrine, but his brothers and sisters still traveled the lands. Though their spirits were twisted by the curse, their powers remained intact, making them a greater threat then even the giants. Though most gods remained lost, Urzach, the god of flies, was not. Insane and desperate, he attacked his own temple. Through the slaughter of his priests and desecration of his holy altars, Urzach strove to annoint his followers so they could bear the mark of his new distorted form.
narrator31_madgod_stream.wav|Urzach proofed the insane gods were free to strike anywhere at any time. But with his defeat there came the soft light of hope. For his example showed even the gods were not unstoppable. The once kind being also proofed there remained a fragment of their former spirit left, trapped beneath the corruption.
narrator32_lines_stream.wav|Of course there were those who believed the Twilight represented a new ordering of things. Fools who claimed the only chance of survival was to embrace it, formed cults, the largest naming itself the Twilight Church. Intent on snatching their share of the future, ministers began to infect their followers with the curse, experimenting with the process of transformation.
narrator33_lines_stream.wav|The first encounter with the Twilight church proofed the start of a thread, destined to unravel a tapestry of corruption. From the first infection sites spread a terrible net of infestations. They spanned the north regions of Shrike up to the Lyrish Border. But still the leaders of the Church remained unseen.
narrator34_ascension_stream.wav|Even as her body was destoyed by Brannocs final blow, still Viridyas spirit did not leave. So passionate was her belief in her cause, Viridyas essence fused with nature, tainting it with her rage. One enemy had been destroyed, but another, perhaps more terrible, had taken its place. The Skylords now had to keep Viridyas minions at bay, as they protected the weakend Jorne, and with him the fragile truce. What is not enough, they would also had to bring her back into balance. As a spirit, Viridyas power was godlike, it would take all the Skylords might to tear her madness from her and grant her peace.

As her unbalanced soul broke apart, deep terrors that had driven her emerged, taking the shape of demons. When all anger had spilled from her and was burned away - even the ancient hate of the Soultree - Viridya finally came to know peace. Her purified spirit flew high into the sky, then hurled itself down into the ocean. She rose once more not as a godess, but as a new land - a strange paradise destined to never know the Twilight taint.
narrator36_passage_stream.wav|From Akylos, the border between the land of the dead and the living, the Harbiner whispered dark promises to Brannoc, praying on his desire to resurrect his beloved wife. It had given the Skylord the curse, so perhaps in its defeat lay the cure for the affliction. But Akylos was not only home to the Harbinger itself with its many faces, it played host to a dangerous cult. Their combined might would require an army of brave Skylords to even have a hope of victory.
narrator37_passage_stream.wav|The Harbinger was no more, and the malice that had seeped into the world of the living through Brannocs curse had been stopped. While those already infected were not cured, the curse would no longer spread. Now, every victory would heal the world a little more.

Leaderless and shunned for their kings dark deeds, they're easy pickings for bandit slavehunters.

Eventually their slaves, the mortals, rebelled - and with the aid of the gods drove their former masters underground. It was a time of great darkness, but also great deeds. Mortal heroes who fought with the gods were raised up as reward for their legendary valor: They became Skylords, companions and advisors to the gods, destined to live forever with them in the Forge of Creation, a magnificent palance in the clouds. A time of prosperity for the mortals began. But one day, the gods abandoned the forge and disappeared without word or trace. The sun began to die, and a cold twilight crept over the world. Terried and alone, most mortals fled underground to find warmth in the caves of the giants. There, they struck a bargain with their old masters: all their gold and jewels for a new sun. In the forge of creation, the Skylords - lost without the gods, turned their gaze down to the mortal world. Some argued the time for watching was over. Other claimed, only the gods should intervene. A new time of stife and discord emerged - thus began the Twilight wars.
